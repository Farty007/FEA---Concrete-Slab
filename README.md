This MATLAB code shows how the geometry described in the problem behaves under its own weight.

You might need to download all the files and put them in the same folder, for the code to run properly. It only pulls the STL file provided and creates a mesh.
For more accurate results, lower the Hmax value. Lowering the Hmax value below that might add a significant amount of time in processing. My laptop runs on Intel I7 10th gen, and 16 GB RAM, and it takes about 5-7 minutes to completely process the code.
